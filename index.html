        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre -Business Student</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Elias Ross Azar and I am currently a first year at the University of California Riverside. I am currently registered in the Pre-Business Program and I plan to improve my professional career. My career goals include applying to law school after getting a bachelor of science degree at the University of California Riverside. If my plans for law school do not go as planned, I intend on using my Business degree with an emphasis on accounting to become a certified public accountant. After I become a lawyer or an accountant, I intend on enlisting into the military as an officer. Enlisting as an officer will open a lot of career opportunities once I finish my time working for the United States government. After that, assuming the lawyer plan works, I intend on either working in a law form or as a corporate lawyer. If I do not become a lawyer, I intend on using my credentials as a certified public accountant and as an officer to either become an accountant for one of the “Big Four” accounting firms or going into corporate accounting. Whether I become a lawyer or an accountant, I intend on either going to a private firm or the corporate field. I will choose whether I go to the corporate field or a private firm depending on my situation at the time. The corporate field involves an easier job; it does pay less when being compared to the private firm.  <br><br>

        My name is Elias Azar and I was born August 19th, 20003. I am half Lebanese half Filipino and am eighteen years old. I am living at the Dundee dorm and I am a first year, full time student  at the University Of California Riverside. My goals are to help my family, friends, and community. I am originally from Los Angeles and attended Saint Genevieve High school from 2017 to 2021. Some of my hobbies include shoe collecting, playing video games, and spending time with family. I am a very social person who is not afraid to talk to new people. I am not shy about many things and I am very open about my life.
<br><br>

       I have worked ever since I was a little kid at my family's Lebanese restaurant. I did jobs that ranged from cleaning the floor to making meals. I was very active in the restaurant business and enjoyed it quite a lot. While I was not the best at cooking and cleaning, I really enjoyed taking orders and inventory. Ever since I was little I was very good at two things; talking and taking down numbers. Even if I was not getting paid, I enjoyed helping out my family and meeting new and interesting people.
